WHAT WORKS:
deleting lists and sublists 
deleting sources works 
deleting populated sublists works

adding a question with a new source
adding a question with an already existing source					adding questions seems to totally work
using the reuse source button works
editing the source after pressing the reuse source button does not cause errors

selecting sublists with no duplicates in the memoriseFacts works

getting a question wrong is processed correctly
getting a question correct is processed correctly

ISSUES:
you can select a sublist and then it's parent list which could lead to selecting duplicates
